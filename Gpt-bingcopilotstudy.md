### Summary of "The Art of Color" by Johannes Itten

**Publication Details**:
"The Art of Color" explores the subjective experience and objective rationale of color. Originally published in Germany as "Kunst der Farbe" in 1961 and 1973, the book was translated by Ernst van Haagen and published in the United States by Van Nostrand Reinhold Company.

**Acknowledgments**:
Johannes Itten expresses gratitude to Mr. Peter Maier and the Otto Maier publishing house for their support and cooperation in bringing his extensive experience with color to a broader audience. He also acknowledges the meticulous work of the Graphische Anstalt E. Wartelsteiner in Munich for ensuring color fidelity in the illustrations, and Mrs. Lucia Moholy for her valuable editorial assistance. Itten credits his wife for her unwavering support and encouragement throughout the project.

**To the new 1973 edition**
Challenges and Improvements:
When preparing the first edition of "The Art of Color" in 1960, the author and publisher faced significant challenges in reproducing colors accurately. This required various printing processes and special colors. By 1970, advancements in technology allowed for improved printing quality in the students' edition, setting a new standard for the larger edition. The 1973 edition adapted the entire production for offset printing, with Seiler & Jehle, Augsburg, playing a crucial role in reproducing the illustrations.

**Acknowledgments**:
The author acknowledges the valuable collaboration of Seiler & Jehle and the excellent printing by J. Fink, Stuttgart-Kemnat. The new edition aimed to make Johannes Itten's color theory available again, adhering strictly to his principles while improving and enlarging some illustrations.

**Contents**:
The book covers a wide range of topics related to color theory, including color physics, color agent and effect, the 12-hue color circle, the seven color contrasts, color mixing, color harmony, and the spatial effect of colors. It also includes a comprehensive list of plates featuring works by various artists such as Mondrian, Picasso, Renoir, and van Gogh.

**List of Plates**:
The plates section includes notable works like "Apocalypse de Saint Sever," "Coronation of the Virgin" by Enguerrand Charonton, "Composition 1928" by Piet Mondrian, "Lemons, Oranges and Rose" by Francisco de Zurbar√°n, and many others. These plates illustrate the practical application of color theory in art.

## Introduction

In the introduction, Itten compares learning from books and teachers to traveling by carriage, which is useful only up to a point. He aims to create a "serviceable conveyance" to help those interested in color artistry. Itten emphasizes that while intuitive understanding is crucial, knowledge of aesthetic color theory, derived from experience and intuition, is also essential. He acknowledges the contributions of his students and the importance of color effects, which are perceived by the heart rather than just the eye.

Itten discusses whether there are general rules for color or if it is purely subjective. He believes that while intuitive creation is valuable, knowledge is necessary for those who cannot create masterpieces instinctively. He stresses that doctrines and theories are helpful in weaker moments, while intuition solves problems in moments of strength.

He highlights the importance of studying great master colorists and their scientific approach to color. Itten aims to address many color problems in his book, exploring both objective principles and subjective experiences. He draws parallels with music composition, noting that technical knowledge alone is insufficient without inspiration.

Itten states that understanding the laws of design can liberate artists from indecision. He acknowledges the complexity and mystery of color effects, which cannot be fully captured by any set of rules.

Itten compares the artist's use of scientific principles to a tortoise drawing its limbs into its shell, suggesting that while these principles are essential, they are reserved for specific moments. He emphasizes that color is life, describing colors as the children of light and darkness. The dramatic impact of natural color phenomena, like rainbows and northern lights, is highlighted for their emotional effects.

He discusses the transcendental essence of color, likening it to music and noting that its true nature is often beyond conceptual understanding. Historical examples illustrate how different cultures, from ancient Egyptians and Greeks to Chinese dynasties and medieval European artists, have used color in their art. 

Itten describes the emotional and aesthetic impact of color in various art forms, including mosaics and stained glass. He provides detailed examples, such as the mausoleum of Galla Placidia, where complementary colors create a unique atmosphere. The introduction reflectis on the profound beauty and emotional power of color in art.

Itten discusses how Romanesque and Early Gothic artists used colors symbolically, aiming for clear and unambiguous tones. He highlights Giotto and the Sienese school for their role in individualizing the human figure in form and color, setting the stage for the rich artistic developments of the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries.

The Van Eyck brothers are noted for their realistic use of local colors to create naturalistic images, exemplified by the Ghent altarpiece and the Arnolfini portrait. Francesca is recognized for his use of sharp outlines and complementary colors, while Leonardo is known for his subtle tonal gradations and use of sepia tones.

Titian's evolution from isolated color areas to complex modulations is discussed, with examples like "Bella" and "Ecce Homo." El Greco, a pupil of Titian, is highlighted for his abstract and expressive use of color, which influenced nonobjective painting.

Grinewald's mastery of color is exemplified by the Isenheim altarpiece, where he used color to convey different themes and emotions. He prioritized artistic truth over decorative unity, integrating symbolic, expressive, and realistic uses of color into a cohesive whole.
