**To the new 1973 edition**
Challenges and Improvements:
When preparing the first edition of "The Art of Color" in 1960, the author and publisher faced significant challenges in reproducing colors accurately. This required various printing processes and special colors. By 1970, advancements in technology allowed for improved printing quality in the students' edition, setting a new standard for the larger edition. The 1973 edition adapted the entire production for offset printing, with Seiler & Jehle, Augsburg, playing a crucial role in reproducing the illustrations.

**Acknowledgments**:
The author acknowledges the valuable collaboration of Seiler & Jehle and the excellent printing by J. Fink, Stuttgart-Kemnat. The new edition aimed to make Johannes Itten's color theory available again, adhering strictly to his principles while improving and enlarging some illustrations.

**Contents**:
The book covers a wide range of topics related to color theory, including color physics, color agent and effect, the 12-hue color circle, the seven color contrasts, color mixing, color harmony, and the spatial effect of colors. It also includes a comprehensive list of plates featuring works by various artists such as Mondrian, Picasso, Renoir, and van Gogh.

**List of Plates**:
The plates section includes notable works like "Apocalypse de Saint Sever," "Coronation of the Virgin" by Enguerrand Charonton, "Composition 1928" by Piet Mondrian, "Lemons, Oranges and Rose" by Francisco de Zurbarán, and many others.

## Introduction

In the introduction, Itten compares learning from books and teachers to traveling by carriage, which is useful only up to a point. He aims to create a "serviceable conveyance" to help those interested in color artistry. Itten emphasizes that while intuitive understanding is crucial, knowledge of aesthetic color theory, derived from experience and intuition, is also essential. He acknowledges the contributions of his students and the importance of color effects, which are perceived by the heart rather than just the eye.

Itten discusses whether there are general rules for color or if it is purely subjective. He believes that while intuitive creation is valuable, knowledge is necessary for those who cannot create masterpieces instinctively. He stresses that doctrines and theories are helpful in weaker moments, while intuition solves problems in moments of strength.

He highlights the importance of studying great master colorists and their scientific approach to color. Itten aims to address many color problems in his book, exploring both objective principles and subjective experiences. He draws parallels with music composition, noting that technical knowledge alone is insufficient without inspiration.

Itten states that understanding the laws of design can liberate artists from indecision. He acknowledges the complexity and mystery of color effects, which cannot be fully captured by any set of rules.

Itten compares the artist's use of scientific principles to a tortoise drawing its limbs into its shell, suggesting that while these principles are essential, they are reserved for specific moments. He emphasizes that color is life, describing colors as the children of light and darkness. The dramatic impact of natural color phenomena, like rainbows and northern lights, is highlighted for their emotional effects.

He discusses the transcendental essence of color, likening it to music and noting that its true nature is often beyond conceptual understanding. Historical examples illustrate how different cultures, from ancient Egyptians and Greeks to Chinese dynasties and medieval European artists, have used color in their art. 

Itten describes the emotional and aesthetic impact of color in various art forms, including mosaics and stained glass. He provides detailed examples, such as the mausoleum of Galla Placidia, where complementary colors create a unique atmosphere. The introduction reflectis on the profound beauty and emotional power of color in art.

Itten discusses how Romanesque and Early Gothic artists used colors symbolically, aiming for clear and unambiguous tones. He highlights Giotto and the Sienese school for their role in individualizing the human figure in form and color, setting the stage for the rich artistic developments of the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries.

The Van Eyck brothers are noted for their realistic use of local colors to create naturalistic images, exemplified by the Ghent altarpiece and the Arnolfini portrait. Francesca is recognized for his use of sharp outlines and complementary colors, while Leonardo is known for his subtle tonal gradations and use of sepia tones.

Titian's evolution from isolated color areas to complex modulations is discussed, with examples like "Bella" and "Ecce Homo." El Greco, a pupil of Titian, is highlighted for his abstract and expressive use of color, which influenced nonobjective painting.

Grinewald's mastery of color is exemplified by the Isenheim altarpiece, where he used color to convey different themes and emotions. He prioritized artistic truth over decorative unity, integrating symbolic, expressive, and realistic uses of color into a cohesive whole.

**Rembrandt and Chiaroscuro**: Rembrandt is renowned for his use of chiaroscuro, a technique also employed by Leonardo, Titian, and El Greco. Unlike his predecessors, Rembrandt treated color as a dense material, creating depth with transparent tones and achieving realistic textures with a mix of tempera and oil paints. His work is characterized by the materialization of light-energy, with pure colors shining like jewels in dull settings.

**Baroque Color**: El Greco and Rembrandt's work leads into the baroque period, where color was used dynamically to create depth illusions. Viennese painter Maulbertsch exemplifies this baroque coloration.

**Empire and Classical Periods**: During these periods, color was limited to black, white, and gray, with few chromatic colors, giving an effect of realism and sobriety. This style was replaced by Romanticism, which used color expressively to convey mood. Turner and Constable in England, and Friedrich and Runge in Germany, were key figures in this movement.

**Romanticism and Delacroix**: Turner and Constable's work influenced Delacroix, who reworked his paintings in their spirit, causing a sensation in Paris. Delacroix remained deeply engaged with color throughout his life.

**19th Century Color Theory**: The early 19th century saw significant interest in color theory. Runge, Goethe, Schopenhauer, and Chevreul made notable contributions, with Chevreul's work laying the scientific foundation for Impressionism and Neo-Impressionism.

**Impressionism**: Impressionists like Monet studied light and its effects on color, leading to new color renditions. Monet's series of cathedral paintings exemplify this approach.

**Neo-Impressionism**: Neo-Impressionists used pointillism, dividing color into dots to be mixed by the viewer's eye, influenced by Chevreul's theories.

**Cézanne's Color Construction**: Cézanne built on Impressionist ideas, rejecting pointillism for continuous color modulation. He integrated color, form, and rhythm across the entire picture, achieving new harmonies and elevating nature to a higher level.

**Matisse and Les Fauves**: Matisse, along with Braque, Derain, and Vlaminck, was part of the Paris group Les Fauves. He avoided modulation to express simple, luminous areas in subjective equilibrium.

**Cubists**: Picasso, Braque, and Gris focused on form, using colors for their light-dark values. They analyzed objects into abstract geometric forms, creating relief-like effects through tonal gradation.

**Expressionists**: Artists like Munch, Kirchner, Heckel, Nolde, and the Blauer Reiter painters (Kandinsky, Marc, Macke, Klee) aimed to restore psychological content to painting, representing internalized experiences through shapes and colors. Kandinsky began painting non-objective pictures around 1908, believing each color has its expressional value.

**Art Concret**: Between 1912 and 1917, artists like Kupka, Delaunay, Malewitsch, Itten, Arp, Mondrian, and Vantongerloo produced non-objective, geometric forms and pure spectral colors. Mondrian used pure colors to create static equilibrium in his paintings.

**Surrealists and Tachistes**: Surrealists like Max Ernst and Salvador Dali used colors to express their "irrealities." Tachistes were "anomalists" in both color and form.

**Contemporary Interest in Color**: Developments in color chemistry, fashion, and photography have increased interest in colors, but this interest is often superficial and not grounded in intellectual and emotional experience. Colors are radiant energies that affect us positively or negatively.

**Scientific Study of Color**: Physicists study the nature of light and color phenomena, chemists focus on dyes and pigments, physiologists investigate the effects of light and colors on the visual apparatus, and psychologists explore the influence of color on the mind and spirit.

**Artists and Color**: Artists are interested in the aesthetic effects of color and need both physiological and psychological information to understand and use color effectively.

**Artist's Interest in Color**: Artists are deeply interested in the aesthetic effects of color, requiring both physiological and psychological information. They explore the relationships between color agents and effects, mediated by the eye and brain, to understand visual, mental, and spiritual phenomena.

**Contrast Effects and Color Aesthetics**: Contrast effects are a starting point in studying color aesthetics, which can be approached from three directions: Impression (visual), Expression (emotional), and Construction (symbolic). Historical and cultural uses of color, such as in pre-Columbian Peru and China, highlight symbolic meanings.

**Symbolic Use of Color**: Colors have been used symbolically in various cultures and religions. For example, yellow in China was reserved for the emperor, symbolizing wisdom and enlightenment, while white was worn during mourning to assist the dead to a state of perfection.

**Emotionally Expressive Power of Colors**: Masters like El Greco and Grünewald exemplify the emotionally expressive power of colors. Impressionists like Manet, Monet, and Renoir studied the effects of changing sunlight on local colors, focusing on color vibrations.

**Three Points of View in Studying Color**: Studying color involves constructional, expressional, and impressional perspectives. Symbolism without visual accuracy and emotional force is mere formalism, while visually impressive effects without symbolic and emotional power are banal. Emotional effects without constructive content or visual strength are limited to sentimental expression.

**Defining Color Quality and Brilliance**: The quality of a color refers to its position in the color circle or solid, with unique chromas resulting from mixtures. Brilliance, or tonal gradation, is the degree of lightness or darkness, varied by mixing with white, black, gray, or another color of unlike brilliance.

## Color physics

**Newton's Spectrum Analysis**: In 1676, Sir Isaac Newton used a triangular prism to analyze white sunlight into a spectrum of colors, excluding purple. By passing sunlight through a slit and prism, he dispersed the light into a continuous band of colors from red to violet. Collecting these colors with a converging lens recombined them into white light. This process, known as refraction, is one of several physical methods to generate colors, including interference, diffraction, polarization, and fluorescence.

**Complementary Colors**: Dividing the spectrum into two parts (e.g., red-orange-yellow and green-blue-violet) and mixing each part with a lens results in two mixed colors that, when combined, yield white. These pairs are called complementary colors. Each spectral hue complements the mixture of all other spectral hues.

**Light Waves and Color Perception**: Colors result from light waves, a type of electromagnetic energy. The human eye perceives light wavelengths between 400 and 700 millimicrons. Each prismatic color has specific wavelengths and frequencies. Color arises in the human eye and brain, not from the light waves themselves.

**Subtractive Colors**: Colors of objects are primarily subtractive, meaning they absorb certain wavelengths and reflect others. For example, a red object absorbs all colors except red. When illuminated with a color it cannot reflect, it appears black. Painter's colors are pigmentary and follow the rules of subtraction, where mixing complementary colors results in black.

**Additive Colors**: In contrast, mixing prismatic, non-corporeal colors (light) results in white, known as additive color mixing.

Here are the physical ways of generating colors:

1. **Refraction**: This occurs when light passes through a medium and bends, separating into its component colors. Sir Isaac Newton's prism experiment is a classic example, where white light is dispersed into a spectrum of colors¹.

2. **Interference**: This phenomenon happens when two or more light waves overlap, either amplifying (constructive interference) or canceling each other out (destructive interference). Thin film interference, like the colors seen in soap bubbles or oil slicks, is a common example².

3. **Diffraction**: This occurs when light waves bend around obstacles or pass through narrow slits, causing the light to spread out and create patterns of colors. The famous double-slit experiment demonstrates this effect².

4. **Polarization**: Polarization involves filtering light waves so that they vibrate in a single plane. This can be achieved through reflection, refraction, or scattering. Polarized sunglasses use this principle to reduce glare³.

5. **Fluorescence**: This happens when a substance absorbs light at one wavelength and emits it at a longer wavelength. Fluorescent materials, like those used in highlighters or certain minerals, exhibit this property¹.

These methods illustrate the diverse ways in which colors can be generated and manipulated through physical processes. If you have any specific questions about these phenomena, feel free to ask!

## Color agent and color effect

**Color Agent and Color Effect**: The color agent refers to the physically or chemically definable pigment, while color effect is the psychophysiological perception of color. The eye and mind achieve distinct perception through comparison and contrast, determining the value of a chromatic color in relation to achromatic colors (black, white, gray) or other chromatic colors.

**Perception and Contrast**: Color perception is influenced by its context. For example, a white square on a black background appears larger than a black square on a white background. Similarly, colors like yellow, red, and blue change their perceived brightness and warmth depending on whether they are placed on white or black backgrounds.

**Simultaneity and Color Composition**: The concept of simultaneity refers to the simultaneous perception of different colors and their effects. This suggests that in color composition, starting with the desired color effect and then developing the size and shape of areas accordingly is advisable. Colors have their own dimensions and directionality, which should guide the composition process.

**Design and Color Areas**: Effective color composition begins with color areas, which then determine the lines. Drawing lines first and adding color later often fails to produce a clear, intense color effect. Colors delineate areas in their own unique way, emphasizing the importance of starting with color in the design process.

## Concord of colors

**Color Harmony**: Color harmony refers to the joint effect of two or more colors. People's judgments of harmony and discord vary, often based on personal sentiments. Harmonious color combinations typically involve similar chromas or colors in the same shades, meeting without sharp contrast. The concept of color harmony should be based on objective principles rather than subjective attitudes, implying balance and symmetry of forces.

**Physiological Phenomena in Color Vision**: Examining physiological phenomena can help solve the problem of color harmony. For example, staring at a green square and then closing your eyes produces a red afterimage, and vice versa. This phenomenon, known as successive contrast, shows the eye's tendency to seek equilibrium by positing the complementary color. Simultaneous contrast occurs when a gray square in an area of pure color appears tinged with the complementary color of the surrounding hue.

**Complementary Colors and Harmony**: Successive and simultaneous contrast suggest that the human eye achieves equilibrium when complementary colors are present. In 1797, Rumford hypothesized that colors are harmonious if they mix to give white. Physically mixing a color with its complementary color yields white light, while pigmentary mixtures result in gray-black.

**Ewald Hering's Perspective**: Physiologist Ewald Hering stated that medium or neutral gray corresponds to a state of equilibrium in the eye, where the consumption and regeneration of the optic substance are equal. This balance generates a state of complete equilibrium in the eye.

**Equilibrium and Medium Gray**: Hering demonstrates that the eye and brain require medium gray to maintain equilibrium. Viewing a white square on a black background and then looking away results in a black afterimage, and vice versa. However, viewing a medium-gray square on a medium-gray background produces no afterimage, indicating that medium gray satisfies the eye's need for balance.

**Psychophysical State of Equilibrium**: Harmony in our visual system signifies a state where the dissimilation and assimilation of optic substances are equal. Neutral gray, which can be mixed from black and white or complementary colors, achieves this state. Complementary colors contain all three primary colors (yellow, red, and blue), and their mixture yields gray, satisfying the eye's need for totality and harmony.

**Harmonious and Discordant Colors**: Colors are harmonious if their mixture results in neutral gray. Other combinations that do not yield gray are expressive or discordant. Some great paintings use a one-sided, expressive color composition, which can be exciting and provocative. Seurat's statement "Art is harmony" is seen as mistaking a means of art for its end.

**Principle of Complementaries**: The basic principle of harmony is derived from the rule of complementaries. Goethe explains that when the eye sees a color, it naturally produces the complementary color to achieve totality. This fundamental rule underlies all color harmony.

**Ostwald's View on Harmony**: Wilhelm Ostwald discusses color harmony in terms of order. Pleasing color combinations have an orderly relationship, while lacking this order results in displeasing effects. Ostwald's color circles of equal shade and triangles of like hue represent harmonious orders. However, Itten argues that harmony should be based on objective principles rather than subjective attitudes.

**Color Circle and Classification**: An essential foundation of aesthetic color theory is the color circle, which determines color classification. For practical use in painting, diametrically opposed colors must be complementary and mix to yield gray. Itten's color circle, where blue stands opposite to orange, is more suitable for painting than Ostwald's, where blue stands opposite to yellow.

Certainly! Here are the summarized paragraphs from the provided material:

Having defined harmony, we now explore the quantitative relationships among colors in harmonious compositions. Goethe estimated the luminosities of primary colors, deriving the proportionality: yellow : red : blue = 3 : 6 : 8.

Complementary pairs, triads forming equilateral or isosceles triangles, and tetrads forming squares or rectangles in the twelve-member color circle are harmonious. Figures 7 and 8 illustrate the harmonious triad of yellow/red/blue, forming an equilateral triangle on the color circle. This triad expresses the highest intensity and force of color, with each color maintaining its distinct character. The eye requires no additional colors, and their mixture results in a dark gray-black.

Figures 9, 10, and 11 show the harmonious tetrad of yellow/red-orange/violet/blue-green. Figure 9 presents these colors in their natural brilliance, occupying continuous harmonious areas. In Figure 10, the colors are broken into small squares, creating instability but enhancing the combination's plastic force. Reducing the brilliance to two levels in Figure 11 results in a two-dimensional effect, with a strong cold-warm contrast between red-orange and blue-green/violet. This transformation creates a new, suspensional timbre. Further reducing the brilliance to one, making all colors as bright as yellow, would yield a different tone.

Harmonious combinations can be varied in many ways. Geometrical figures like equilateral and isosceles triangles, squares, and rectangles can be drawn from any point on the color circle and rotated to create different harmonious combinations. Further discussion on harmonic variations is provided in the relevant section.

## Subjective timbre

In 1928, Johannes Itten assigned harmonic color combinations to an art class without defining color harmony. The students found the combinations discordant and unpleasant. Itten then allowed each student to paint their own harmonious combinations, revealing that each had a unique perception of color harmony. This experiment highlighted the concept of subjective color, where individual preferences dictate what is considered harmonious.

Itten observed that successful experiments in subjective color require prior sensitization to color through intensive study and practice. He noted that subjective color experiments should be approached carefully to avoid revealing personal traits or feelings, as many people are hesitant to expose their true selves. Early attempts often reflect wish fulfillments rather than true personal preferences.

Subjective color harmonies can range from narrow palettes with only a few colors to wide scales with many shades. Some individuals may see the world through a dominant hue, influencing their perception and emotional response. The choice and arrangement of colors, as well as the size and orientation of areas, can reveal much about a person's thought processes and emotional state.

Itten's studies showed that subjective color choices are highly individualistic. For example, one student might use pure, distinct colors with a focus on hue contrast, while another might prefer darker shades with black accents, suggesting a more intense and emotional personality. These observations underscore the importance of considering individual differences in color perception and harmony.

Figs. 18-21: This student exhibits intense coloration with strong contrasts among the primary colors yellow, red, and blue. The floral essay painted after discovering her subjective combination shows a joyous freshness and straightforwardness. This discovery brought her self-confidence and vitality, emphasizing the importance of aligning painting themes with personal color qualities for a more profound artistic experience.

The development of a painting personality should stem from an individual's inherent predispositions of form and color. Understanding subjective timbres is crucial in education and art instruction. Educators must recognize and nurture each student's unique aptitudes and potentialities. Helping students discover their subjective forms and colors is akin to helping them discover themselves, fostering organic growth and self-expression.

Art education faces two main challenges: enhancing individual creative aptitudes and teaching general objective rules of form and color. Assignments should align with students' subjective forms and colors to amplify their natural abilities. For instance, the student of Fig. 15 should explore themes like Night and Grief, using soft charcoal or black and white pigments, while the girl of Fig. 12 should focus on vivid subjects like Springtime and Bright Flowers, avoiding light-dark contrasts.

It is essential to provide individualized, subjectively slanted assignments rather than imposing standard studies on all students. This approach allows students to intuitively find correct solutions and prevents them from struggling with themes that are alien to their nature. Once students grasp their color principles, they can engage in elementary exercises in various form and color contrasts, discovering their preferences and challenges. Grounding in universal principles is necessary for all students, as it generates natural tensions that inspire new creations.

#### Subjective Timbre and Artistic Preferences
Illustrating contrasts through analyses of past and present paintings greatly benefits learners. Encountering works that challenge and interest them helps learners identify their preferences and masters. Some may be drawn to light-dark contrasts, others to hue, form, or architectural composition. Preferences can vary widely, from the strong colorism of the Expressionists to the shape nihilism of the Tachistes.

#### Discovering Key Colors
A student initially painted with gray, blue, white, and red, which seemed to be her key colors. However, she later experimented with orange, black, and purple, showing her broad and deep personality. Her exercises on the four seasons were strongly defined, with summer and autumn showing the most power and life. Her subjective color combinations revealed inner structures not evident in her outward personality.

#### Understanding Total Personality
The total personality is rarely fully comprehended through subjective colors alone. Physical, mental, or spiritual aspects may dominate, or various composites may be present. The emphasis varies with individual temperament and disposition. Teachers, physicians, and vocational counselors can draw valuable inferences from subjective colors.

#### Case Studies of Subjective Colors
One student’s subjective colors were light violet, light blue, blue-gray, yellow, white, and a touch of black, indicating a hard, cold, and somewhat brittle tone. Despite his affinity for metals and glass, he became a successful architect in concrete and glass. Another student’s colors included orange-brown, ocher, red-brown, and black, leading him to become a woodworker. A third student’s colors of light-violet, yellowish, and gold-brown suggested great concentration and a religious tendency, leading him to become a sacristan and engraver.

#### Vocational Suitability
A person can only excel in an occupation that suits their constitution and for which they have the requisite aptitudes. The subjective colors can provide insights into an individual's natural inclinations and potential career paths.

**Tachisme** (or Tachism) is a French style of abstract painting that emerged in the 1940s and 1950s. The term is derived from the French word "tache," meaning "stain" or "spot." This art movement is characterized by spontaneous brushwork, drips, and blobs of paint applied directly from the tube, often creating irregular dabs and splotches of color¹².

Tachisme was a reaction against the structured forms of Cubism and geometric abstraction. Instead, it embraced an intuitive and instinctive form of expression, similar to the action painting seen in American Abstract Expressionism¹. Artists working in this style often used techniques like pouring paint, using perforated containers, or applying paint with fingers to create their works².

Notable artists associated with Tachisme include Jean Dubuffet, Pierre Soulages, and Georges Mathieu¹. The movement is also closely related to Art Informel, which emphasizes a lack of premeditated structure and a more spontaneous approach to art¹.

Figs. 30-35: A melancholy dusk of clouded colors surrounds the light and brilliant combinations within the squares, representing concealed beauty unable to emerge. The four seasons depicted (Figs. 32-35) share this melancholy, with gray and sunless representations. The autumnal mood is more universally valid as its color expression aligns with the subjective chord.

In Figs. 146-149, Itten attempts an objective color characterization of the four seasons using different polytones. Comparing these with earlier versions (Figs. 25-28 and 32-35) highlights the significant influence of subjective attachment to certain colors. Despite varied opinions, Itten found that people consistently identified the seasons correctly, suggesting a higher intellectual judgment that transcends individual taste.

Itten identifies three attitudes among painters towards color problems: epigoni, who lack their own coloration and mimic others; originals, who paint according to their subjective timbre, maintaining consistent chromatic expression; and universalists, who adapt their color treatment to each composition based on inclusive, objective considerations. The latter group is rare, requiring a comprehensive understanding of the entire color circle and high intelligence.

Subjective timbre reflects a person's inner being, with their color combinations revealing their mode of thought, feeling, and action. These colors are generated by the dispersion and filtration of white light and electromagnetic vibrations within the individual's psycho-physiological medium. Upon death, the individual loses color as the light of life extinguishes, leaving the corpse devoid of chromatic emanation.

Interpretation of subjective color combinations should consider the overall timbre, including the placement, direction, brilliance, clarity, proportions, textures, and rhythmic relationships of colors. Decorators and designers often rely on their subjective color preferences, which can lead to misunderstandings. Objective considerations, such as using light green and blue-green tones in a meat market to make meats appear fresher, are crucial for solving many color-related problems.

Gardeners face daily challenges involving form and color, considering plant growth, shapes, and colors of blossoms, foliage, and fruit. They must account for soil, surrounding vegetation, rocks, and light conditions to achieve desired effects. Florists, constrained by seasonal availability, must find objectively correct combinations for various occasions, such as joyful hues for weddings and delicate colors for christenings.

Salespeople benefit from understanding customers' color preferences rather than imposing their own. Knowing which colors complement or modify others is essential. Fashion designers must be familiar with general principles of form and color to create successful lines, even if the required hues differ from their subjective preferences. Interior decorators and architects should consider the color preferences of their clients to create congenial environments.

For application developers, understanding color theory is vital for creating visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces. Colors can evoke specific emotional responses, influencing user engagement and satisfaction. Effective use of color combinations and contrasts can enhance readability, accessibility, and overall user experience. Developers must consider cultural and contextual factors to ensure their applications resonate with a diverse audience⁵⁶⁷.

## Theory of color design

Constructive color theory involves principles of color effects derived empirically. When Rainer Maria Rilke asked Rodin about the creative process, Rodin described it as starting with an intense feeling that becomes concrete, leading to planning and design, and finally, execution guided by feeling. Cézanne and Matisse also balanced rational planning with intuitive feeling in their work, showing that while calculated plans are important, intuitive feeling ultimately guides the creative process.

Intuitive feeling navigates the irrational and metaphysical realms, surpassing deliberate intellectual construction. To learn objective color principles, one must practice by reproducing charts and exercises. The book provides elementary examples, but students should create their own plates for other colors to progress beyond theoretical knowledge.

## 12-hue color circle 

![Fig. 37](Image/15.jpg "Fig. 37")

1. **Introduction to the 12-Hue Color Circle**:
   - The 12-hue color circle is developed from the primary colors: yellow, red, and blue.
   - Each primary color is placed in an equilateral triangle, with yellow at the top, red at the lower right, and blue at the lower left.

2. **Creating Secondary Colors**:
   - A circle is drawn around the triangle, and a hexagon is inscribed within it.
   - Secondary colors are created by mixing two primary colors: yellow + red = orange, yellow + blue = green, red + blue = violet.
   - These secondary colors must be mixed carefully to avoid leaning towards either primary component.

3. **Adding Tertiary Colors**:
   - Another circle is drawn outside the first, divided into twelve equal sectors.
   - Tertiary colors are placed in the blank sectors between the primary and secondary colors: yellow + orange = yellow-orange, red + orange = red-orange, etc.

4. **Color Circle and Spectrum**:
   - The 12-hue color circle is constructed with each hue in its specific place, following the sequence of the rainbow or natural spectrum.
   - Newton's color circle included purple to connect red and violet, creating an augmented spectrum.

5. **Complementary Colors and Visualization**:
   - The twelve hues are evenly spaced, with complementary colors opposite each other.
   - The author argues against creating overly complex color circles, emphasizing the importance of precise color names for meaningful discussion.

6. **Historical Context and Influence**:
   - Delacroix, an influential colorist, kept a color circle in his studio, inspiring Impressionists and other modern artists to use logical, objective color principles.
