#### ACKNOWLEDGMENT  

When the plans for this book were at the stage  of discussion between Mr. Peter Maier and myself, he already fully appreciated the technical  difficulties involved in so ambitious an undertaking.  As a result of his courageous decision, the  publishers have worked indefatigably to make my  experience of color available to a larger audience  beyond the classroom. I am  grateful to the  publishing house of Otto Maier for their faith in  my project and for their splendid cooperation.  Members of the staff were consistently helpful in  dealing skillfully with the many problems that  arose.   The Graphische Anstalt E. Wartelsteiner, of  Munich, has devoted the most painstaking attention  to color fidelity in the reproduction of the  illustrations.   Mrs. Lucia Moholy has been of valuable aid to  me in the editing of the manuscript.   This book could never have been completed  without the unfailing assistance and encouragement  of my wife.

#### To the new 1973 edition 

When preparing the first edition of “The Art of Color” in 1960, author and publisher faced the difficult problem of finding the best way of reproducing the color. This could only be achieved by producing the various color illustrations and tables in  different printing processes done by several printers - partly with special colors - and tipping them in the book. In 1970, when the students’ edition was planned, this complicated method of production could not be retained. Thanks to advanced technology, the printing quality of the students’ edition was in many  ways an improvement over the large edition. Thus, a standard was set for a new large edition. For the present new printing, the entire production was  adapted for offset. The reproduction of all the illustrations was done  by Seiler & Jehle, Augsburg, without whose valuab-  le collaboration the book could not have appeared  in its present form. We gratefully acknowledge here  this accomplishment, as well as the excellent printing by J. Fink, StuttgartKemnat. All together, care was taken to leave the work un-  touched. Contents and sequence of pages have  been retained, some of the illustrations enlarged  and improved according to existing copies. The aim  of the new edition is to make Johannes Itten’s color  theory available again, improved and strictly adhering to his principles of presentation.

#### INTRODUCTION 

Learning from books and teachers is like traveling by carriage, so we are told in the Veda. The thought goes on, “But the carriage will serve only while one is on the highroad. He who reaches the end of the highroad will leave the carriage and walk afoot.” 

In this book I shall try to build a serviceable conveyance that will help all who are interested in the problems of color artistry. One may travel carriageless and by unblazed trails, but progress is then slow and the journey perilous. If a high and distant goal is to be attained, then it is advisable to take a carriage at first in order to advance swiftly and safely. 

Many of my students have helped me to find materials with which to build, and I am deeply indebted to them. The doctrine to be developed here is an aesthetic color theory originating in the experience and intuition of a painter. For the artist, effects are decisive, rather than agents as studied by physics and chemistry. Because color effects are in the eye of the beholder, the many color plates were indispensable. Yet the deepest and truest secrets of color effect are, I know, invisible even to the eye, and are beheld by the heart alone. The essential eludes conceptual formulation. 

In the realm of aesthetics, are there general rules and laws of color for the artist, or is the aesthetic appreciation of colors governed solely by subjective Opinion? Students often ask this question, and my answer is always the same: “If you, unknowing, are able to create masterpieces in color, then un-knowledge is your way. But if you are unable to create masterpieces in color out of your un- knowledge, then you ought to look for knowledge.” 

Doctrines and theories are best for weaker moments. In moments of strength, problems are solved intuitively, as if of themselves. 

Close study of the great master colorists has firmly convinced me that all of them possessed a science of color. For me, the theories of Goethe, Runge, Bezold, Chevreul and Hélzel have been invaluable. 

I hope to be able to resolve a great many color problems in this book. We are not merely to expound objective principles and rules, but also to explore and survey the subjective predicament, as it pertains to critical taste in the realm of color. 

We can be released from subjective bondage only through knowledge and awareness of objective principles. 

In music, the theory of composition has long been an important and accepted part of a professional education. However, a musician may know counterpoint and still be a dull composer, if he lacks insight and inspiration. Just so, a painter may know all the resources of composition in form and color, yet remain sterile if inspiration be denied him. 

It has been said that genius is 99 per cent perspiration and I per cent inspiration. There was a debate in the press years ago between Richard Strauss and Hans Pfitzner about the relative shares of inspiration and contrapuntal deduction in the process of composition. Strauss wrote that four to six bars were inspiration in his own works, and the rest elaboration. Pfitzner replied, “It may well be that Strauss is inspired only through four to six bars, but I have noticed that Mozart often composes many pages together under inspiration.” 

Leonardo, Direr, Grinewald, El Greco and the rest did not scorn to examine their artistic media intellectually. How could the Isenheim altarpiece have been produced, had not its creator pondered form and color? 

Knowledge of the laws of design need not imprison, it can liberate from indecision and vacillating perception. What we call laws of color, obviously, can be no more than fragmentary, given the complexity and irrationality of color effects. 

In the course of time, the human mind has penetrated many mysteries in their essence or in their mechanism - the rainbow, thunder and lightning, gravity and so on. But they are still mysteries for all that. 

Delacroix wrote, “The elements of color theory have been neither analyzed nor taught in our schools of art, because in France it is considered superfluous to study the laws of color, according to the saying ‘Draftsmen may be made, but colorists are born.’ Secrets of color theory? Why call those principles secrets which all artists must know and all should have been taught?” (Les Artistes de mon Temps). 

As the tortoise draws its limbs into its shell at need, so the artist reserves his scientific principles when working intuitively. But would it be better for the tortoise to have no legs? 

Color is life; for a world without colors appears to us as dead. Colors are primordial ideas, children of the aboriginal colorless light and its counterpart, colorless darkness. As flame begets light, so light engenders colors. Colors are the children of light, and light ts their mother. Light, that first phenomenon of the world, reveals to us the spirit and living soul of the world through colors. 

Nothing affects the human mind more dramati- cally than the apparition of a gigantic color corona in the heavens. Thunder and lightning frighten us; but the colors of the rainbow and the northern lights soothe and elevate the soul. The rainbow is accounted a symbol of peace. 

The word and its sound, form and its color, are vessels of a transcendental essence that we dimly surmise. As sound lends sparkling color to the spoken word, so color lends psychically resolved tone to form. 

The primeval essence of color is a phantas- magorical resonance, light become music. At the moment when thought, concept, formulation, touch upon color, its spell is broken, and we hold in our hands a corpse. 

In the tinted monuments of past ages, we can trace the emotional dispositions of vanished peoples. The ancient Egyptians and Greeks greatly delighted in varicolored design. 

The Chinese were accomplished painters from early times. An emperor of the Han dynasty is recorded in 80 B.C. to have kept storehouses — a museum — of paintings collected by him, said to have been of great and colorful beauty. In the T'ang period (618-907 A.D), there arose a strongly colored mural and panel painting. About the same time, new yellow, red, green and blue ceramic glazes were developed. In the Sung dynasty (960-1279 A.D.), the sense of color was extraordinarily cultivated. Pictorial colors became more varied and at once more naturalistic. Ceramics evolved many new glazes of matchless beauty, such as celadon and clair de lune. 

Strongly colored Roman and Byzantine poly- chrome mosaics from the first millennium of the Christian era have been preserved in Europe. Mosaic art placed high demands on coloristic powers, because each color area is composed of numerous point elements, each requiring consider- ation and choice. The mosaic artists of Ravenna in the fifth and sixth centuries were able to produce many different effects with complementary colors. 

The mausoleum of Galla Placidia is dominated by a remarkable colored atmosphere of gray light. This effect is produced by bathing the blue mosaic walls of the interior in an orange light, filtered through narrow windows of orange-tinted alabaster. Orange and blue are complementary colors, the mixing of which yields gray. As the visitor moves about the shrine, he receives different quantities of light which is alternately accented blue and orange, the walls reflecting these colors at ever-changing angles. This interplay gives an impression of suffusion with color. 

In the early medieval illuminations of the Irish monks in the eighth and ninth centuries, we find a palette of great variety and subtlety. Most astonishing in their radiant power are those pages where the many different colors are rendered in equal brilliance. The resulting vivid cold-warm effects are such as we do not find again until the Impressionists and Van Gogh. Some leaves of the Book of Kells, for logic of chromatic execution and organic rhythm of line, are as magnificent and pure as a Bach fugue. The sensitivity and artistic intelli- gence of these “abstract” miniaturists had their monumental counterpart in the stained glass of the Middle Ages. Early stained glass employed only a few different colors, and therefore seems crude, for glassmaking techniques afforded few colors as yet. Anyone who has spent a day studying the windows in the cathedral at Chartres in the changing light, and has seen the setting sun kindle the great rose window to a splendid culminating chord, will never forget the supernal beauty of that moment. 

The Romanesque and Early Gothic artists, in their mural and tablet paintings, used colors as symbolic expressions. Therefore they endeavored to produce unequivocal, unclouded tones. Simple and clear symbolic effect was sought, rather than multitudinous shadings and chromatic variations. Form received a similar treatment. 

Giotto and the Sienese school may have been the first painters to indivualize the human figure in form and color, thus initiating a development that was to lead to the imposing throng of artist personalities encountered in the Europe of the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. 

In the first half of the fifteenth century, the brothers Hubert and Jan van Eyck began to construct patterns of composition around the local colors of the person or thing represented. These local colors, through dull and bright, light and dark tones, produced realistic images very closely approaching nature. Color became a means of characterizing natural objects. The Ghent altarpiece was finished in 1432, and in 1434 Jan van Eyck executed the first Gothic portrait, the double portrait of Arnolfini and his lady. 

Francesca (1410-1492) painted individuals in sharp outline and clearly expressive areas, with balancing complementary colors. The hues are rare tones especially characteristic of the artist. 

Leonardo (1452-1519) rejected strong coloration. He painted in infinitesimal tonal gradations, organized in the case of his “Virgin of the Grotto” into two principal planes. “St. Jerome” and the “Adoration” are composed entirely in sepia tones of light and shade. 

Titian (1477 - 1576) in his early work set homogeneous color areas against each other in isolation. Later, he progressively resolved such areas into cool and warm, light and dark, dull and intense modulations, perhaps best exemplified by the “Bella”, in the Pitti galleries. In the works of his old age, he evolved objects out of one principal hue and many variant tints and shades. The “Ecce Homo” is an example.
 
Fl Greco (1545 - 1614) was a pupil of Titian. He brought his master’s polytonality back to large, expressive color areas. His strange, frequently shocking color renditions cease to represent local colors, but are abstract, matching the psychically expressive requirements of the theme. This is why El Greco is considered a progenitor of nonobjective painting. His color areas do not denote objective categories. They have been organized into sheer pictorial polyphony. 

Grinewald (1475 - 1528), a century earlier, had solved this same problem. Where El Greco’s shades are always sharply and characteristically defined by gray and black tones, Grinewald set color against color. Through what may be called an objective mastery of the universe of color, he discovered the appropriate colors for each pictorial motif. The Isenheim altarpiece in all its parts shows such multiplicity of color quality, effect and expression as to be properly called an intellectually universal color composition. The Annunciation, Angel Choir (Plate IX), Crucifixion, Resurrection (Plate XXVII), are pictures utterly different from each other, in form as well as color. 

In fact, Grinewald sacrificed decorative unity of the altarpiece as a whole to artistic truth of the individual theme. He set himself above the scholastic canon, in order to be truthful and objective. However, the psychologically expressive power of his colors, their symbolic verity, and their realistic signification — all these three potentialities of color are, in a deeper sense, fused into unity. 

Rembrandt (1606 - 1669) is considered the exemplar of chiaroscuro painters. Though Leonardo, Titian and Ej Greco used chiaroscuro as a means of expression, Rembrandt's work is altogether different. He felt color as a dense material. With gray and blue or yellow and red transparent tones, he created an effect of depth that has a remarkably transfigured life of its own. Employing a mixed paste of tempera and oil paints, he achieved textures radiating an uncommonly affecting realism (Plate VI, Man in Golden Helmet). In Rembrandt, color becomes materialized light-energy, charged with tension. Pure colors often shine like jewels in dull settings.  
    El Greco and Rembrandt carry us into the problems of baroque color. In the more extreme baroque architectures, static space is resolved into space with dynamic rhythm. Color is enlisted in the same service. It is detached from its objective denotation and becomes an abstract means of rhythmic articulation. Ultimately, it is used to assist depth illusions. The work of the Viennese painter Maulbertsch (1724 - 1796) exhibits such characteristically baroque coloration. 

In the art of the Empire and Classical periods, coloration is confined to black, white, gray, sparingly enlivened with some few chromatic colors. This style, giving an effect of realism and sobriety, was supplanted by Romanticism. The beginning of the Romantic movement in painting is identified with Turner (1775 - 1851) and Constable (1776 - 1837) in England. Its greatest exponents in Germany were Caspar David Friedrich (1774-1840) and Philipp Otto Runge (1777 - 1810). These painters employed color as a psychico-expressive medium, to lend “mood” to landscape. Constable, for example, would not apply homogeneous green to canvas, but would resolve it into minute gradations of light and dark, cold and warm, dull and vivid tones. Color areas were thus rendered subtly vital. Turner produced some non-objective color compositions that would warrant listing him as the first “abstractionist” among European painters. 
    Delacroix (1798 - 1863) saw Turner’s and Constable’s work when he was in London. Their colorism interested him deeply, and on his return, he re-did some paintings of his own in the same spirit, thereby causing a sensation at the 1820 Salon de Paris. Delacroix was actively concerned with color problems and principles throughout his lifetime. 

General interest in the influence and rationale of color prevailed early in the nineteenth century. Runge published his color theory using the sphere as a coordinate system in 1810. Goethe's major work on color appeared likewise in 1810, and in 1816 Schopenhaver published his treatise “On Vision and Colors.” The chemist M. E. Chevreul (1786 - 1889), manager of the Gobelin works in Paris, published his “De la Loi du Contraste Simultané des Couleurs et de l’Assortiment des Objets Coloris” in 1839. This work was to become the scientific foundation of Impressionist and Neo-Impressionist painting. 

Intensive study of nature led the Impressionists to an entirely new color rendition. Study of sunlight, which alters the local tones of natural objects, and study of light in the atmospheric world of landscape, provided the Impressionist painters with new essential patterns. Monet explored these phenomena conscientiously, requiring a fresh canvas to represent a landscape at each hour of the day, so that the progress of the sun and resulting change in color of the light and reflections might be truly rendered. The best demonstration of this procedure are his cathedral paintings, on display in the Jeu de Paume Museum in Paris. 

The Neo-Impressionists divided color areas into point elements. They affirmed that mixing pigments breaks the power of the colors. The dots of pure color were to become mingled only in the eye of the viewer. 
    The color theories of Chevreul were of signal aid to the Impressionists. 

Proceeding from Impressionist ideas, Cézanne arrived at a logically developed color construction. It was his task to fashion Impressionism into something “substantial”; his pictures were to stand upon formal and chromatic principle. Apart from his rhythmic and formal contributions, in color he rejected the Pointillist technique of division, returning to continuous areas modulated internally. To him, modulating a color meant varying it between cold and warm, light and dark, or dull and intense. Such modulation throughout the picture area accomplished new, vivid harmonies. 
    Titian and Rembrandt had contented themselves with color modulations of faces and figures; Cézanne was now integrating the whole picture formally, rhythmically and chromatically. In the still life “Apples and Oranges” (Plate XII), this new integration is clearly apparent. Cézanne wished to remold nature at a higher level. To do this, he employed the cold-warm contrast with musical, ethereal effect. Cézanne, and Bonnard after him, composed some pictures entirely on the cold-warm theme. 

Matisse refrained from modulation, to again express simple, luminous areas in subjective equilibrium. With Braque, Derain and Vlaminck, he belonged to the Paris group Les Fauves. 

The Cubists — Picasso, Braque and Gris — used colors for their light-dark values. They were primarily interested in form. They analyzed the shapes of objects into abstract geometric forms, obtaining relief-like effects by tonal gradation. 

The Expressionists — Munch, Kirchner, Heckel, Nolde, and the Blauer Reiter painters Kandinsky, Marc, Macke, Klee — were attempting to restore psychological content to painting. Their creative aim was to represent internalized and spiritualized experience by means of shapes and colors. 
    Kandinsky began painting non-objective pictures about 1908. He contended that every color has its proper expressional value, and that it is therefore possible to create meaningful realities without representing objects. 

Adolf Hélzel became the center of a group of young painters in Stuttgart who attended his lectures on color theory, based on the discoveries of Goethe, Schopenhauer and Bezold.
    Between 1912 and 1917, in various parts of Europe independently, artists were at work producing what may be subsumed under the collective name “art concret”. Among them were Kupka, Delaunay, Malewitsch, Itten, Arp, Mondrian and Vantongerloo. Their paintings represent non-objective, usually geometric forms and pure spectral colors in the guise of actual corporeal objects. The intellectually apperceptible forms and colors are media that admit of clear pictorial arrangement. 
More recently, Mondrian made a further contribution. He used pure yellow, red, and blue, like weights, to construct paintings whose form and color coincide in the effect of static equilibrium. He aimed not at surreptitious expression, nor at intellectual symbolism, but at real, optically distinct, concrete harmonic patterns (Plate IV). 
    The Surrealists -— Max Ernst, Salvador Dali and the others — have employed colors as means of expression for the pictorial realization of their “irrealities.” 
As for the Tachistes, they are “anomalists” in color as well as in form. 

Developments in color chemistry, fashion, and color photography have aroused a broad general interest in colors, and the color sensitivity of the individual has been greatly refined. But this contemporary interest in color is almost wholly visual, material in character, and not grounded in intellectual and emotional experience. It is a superficial, external toying with metaphysical forces. 
    Colors are forces, radiant energies that affect us positively or negatively, whether we are aware of it or not. The artists in stained glass used color to create a supramundane, mystical atmosphere which would transport the meditations of the worshiper to a spiritual plane. The effects of colors should be experienced and understood, not only visually, but also psychologically and symbolically. 
The problems of color can thus be examined from several aspects. 

The physicist studies the nature of the electromagnetic energy vibrations and particles involved in the phenomena of light, the several origins of color phenomena such as the prismatic dispersion of white light, and the problems of pigmentation. He investigates mixtures of chromatic light, spectra of the elements, frequencies and wave lengths of colored light rays. Measurement and classification of colors are also topics of physical research. 

The chemist studies the molecular structure of dyes and pigments, problems of color fastness, vehicles, and preparation of synthetic dyes. Color chemistry today embraces an extraordinarily wide field of industrial research and production. 

The physiologist investigates the various effects of light and colors on our visual apparatus — eye and brain - and their anatomical relationships and functions. Research on light- and dark-adapted vision and on chromatic color vision occupies an important place. The phenomenon of afterimages is another physiological topic. 

The psychologist is interested in problems of the influence of color radiation on our mind and spirit. Color symbolism, and the subjective perception and discrimination of colors, are important psychological problems. Expressive color effects — what Goethe called the ethico-aesthetic values of colors — likewise fall within the psychologist’s province. 

The artist, finally, is interested in color effects from their aesthetic aspect, and needs both physio- logical and psychological information.
