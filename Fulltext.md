#### ACKNOWLEDGMENT  

When the plans for this book were at the stage  of discussion between Mr. Peter Maier and myself, he already fully appreciated the technical  difficulties involved in so ambitious an undertaking.  As a result of his courageous decision, the  publishers have worked indefatigably to make my  experience of color available to a larger audience  beyond the classroom. I am  grateful to the  publishing house of Otto Maier for their faith in  my project and for their splendid cooperation.  Members of the staff were consistently helpful in  dealing skillfully with the many problems that  arose.   The Graphische Anstalt E. Wartelsteiner, of  Munich, has devoted the most painstaking attention  to color fidelity in the reproduction of the  illustrations.   Mrs. Lucia Moholy has been of valuable aid to  me in the editing of the manuscript.   This book could never have been completed  without the unfailing assistance and encouragement  of my wife.

#### To the new 1973 edition 

When preparing the first edition of “The Art of Color” in 1960, author and publisher faced the difficult problem of finding the best way of reproducing the color. This could only be achieved by producing the various color illustrations and tables in  different printing processes done by several printers - partly with special colors - and tipping them in the book. In 1970, when the students’ edition was planned, this complicated method of production could not be retained. Thanks to advanced technology, the printing quality of the students’ edition was in many  ways an improvement over the large edition. Thus, a standard was set for a new large edition. For the present new printing, the entire production was  adapted for offset. The reproduction of all the illustrations was done  by Seiler & Jehle, Augsburg, without whose valuab-  le collaboration the book could not have appeared  in its present form. We gratefully acknowledge here  this accomplishment, as well as the excellent printing by J. Fink, StuttgartKemnat. All together, care was taken to leave the work un-  touched. Contents and sequence of pages have  been retained, some of the illustrations enlarged  and improved according to existing copies. The aim  of the new edition is to make Johannes Itten’s color  theory available again, improved and strictly adhering to his principles of presentation.

#### INTRODUCTION 

Learning from books and teachers is like traveling by carriage, so we are told in the Veda. The thought goes on, “But the carriage will serve only while one is on the highroad. He who reaches the end of the highroad will leave the carriage and walk afoot.” 

In this book I shall try to build a serviceable conveyance that will help all who are interested in the problems of color artistry. One may travel carriageless and by unblazed trails, but progress is then slow and the journey perilous. If a high and distant goal is to be attained, then it is advisable to take a carriage at first in order to advance swiftly and safely. 

Many of my students have helped me to find materials with which to build, and I am deeply indebted to them. The doctrine to be developed here is an aesthetic color theory originating in the experience and intuition of a painter. For the artist, effects are decisive, rather than agents as studied by physics and chemistry. Because color effects are in the eye of the beholder, the many color plates were indispensable. Yet the deepest and truest secrets of color effect are, I know, invisible even to the eye, and are beheld by the heart alone. The essential eludes conceptual formulation. 

In the realm of aesthetics, are there general rules and laws of color for the artist, or is the aesthetic appreciation of colors governed solely by subjective Opinion? Students often ask this question, and my answer is always the same: “If you, unknowing, are able to create masterpieces in color, then un-knowledge is your way. But if you are unable to create masterpieces in color out of your un- knowledge, then you ought to look for knowledge.” 

Doctrines and theories are best for weaker moments. In moments of strength, problems are solved intuitively, as if of themselves. 

Close study of the great master colorists has firmly convinced me that all of them possessed a science of color. For me, the theories of Goethe, Runge, Bezold, Chevreul and Hélzel have been invaluable. 

I hope to be able to resolve a great many color problems in this book. We are not merely to expound objective principles and rules, but also to explore and survey the subjective predicament, as it pertains to critical taste in the realm of color. 

We can be released from subjective bondage only through knowledge and awareness of objective principles. 

In music, the theory of composition has long been an important and accepted part of a professional education. However, a musician may know counterpoint and still be a dull composer, if he lacks insight and inspiration. Just so, a painter may know all the resources of composition in form and color, yet remain sterile if inspiration be denied him. 

It has been said that genius is 99 per cent perspiration and I per cent inspiration. There was a debate in the press years ago between Richard Strauss and Hans Pfitzner about the relative shares of inspiration and contrapuntal deduction in the process of composition. Strauss wrote that four to six bars were inspiration in his own works, and the rest elaboration. Pfitzner replied, “It may well be that Strauss is inspired only through four to six bars, but I have noticed that Mozart often composes many pages together under inspiration.” 

Leonardo, Direr, Grinewald, El Greco and the rest did not scorn to examine their artistic media intellectually. How could the Isenheim altarpiece have been produced, had not its creator pondered form and color? 

Knowledge of the laws of design need not imprison, it can liberate from indecision and vacillating perception. What we call laws of color, obviously, can be no more than fragmentary, given the complexity and irrationality of color effects. 

In the course of time, the human mind has penetrated many mysteries in their essence or in their mechanism - the rainbow, thunder and lightning, gravity and so on. But they are still mysteries for all that. 

Delacroix wrote, “The elements of color theory have been neither analyzed nor taught in our schools of art, because in France it is considered superfluous to study the laws of color, according to the saying ‘Draftsmen may be made, but colorists are born.’ Secrets of color theory? Why call those principles secrets which all artists must know and all should have been taught?” (Les Artistes de mon Temps).
