#### ACKNOWLEDGMENT  

When the plans for this book were at the stage  of discussion between Mr. Peter Maier and myself, he already fully appreciated the technical  difficulties involved in so ambitious an undertaking.  As a result of his courageous decision, the  publishers have worked indefatigably to make my  experience of color available to a larger audience  beyond the classroom. I am  grateful to the  publishing house of Otto Maier for their faith in  my project and for their splendid cooperation.  Members of the staff were consistently helpful in  dealing skillfully with the many problems that  arose.   The Graphische Anstalt E. Wartelsteiner, of  Munich, has devoted the most painstaking attention  to color fidelity in the reproduction of the  illustrations.   Mrs. Lucia Moholy has been of valuable aid to  me in the editing of the manuscript.   This book could never have been completed  without the unfailing assistance and encouragement  of my wife.

#### To the new 1973 edition 

When preparing the first edition of “The Art of Color” in 1960, author and publisher faced the difficult problem of finding the best way of reproducing the color. This could only be achieved by producing the various color illustrations and tables in  different printing processes done by several printers - partly with special colors - and tipping them in the book. In 1970, when the students’ edition was planned, this complicated method of production could not be retained. Thanks to advanced technology, the printing quality of the students’ edition was in many  ways an improvement over the large edition. Thus, a standard was set for a new large edition. For the present new printing, the entire production was  adapted for offset. The reproduction of all the illustrations was done  by Seiler & Jehle, Augsburg, without whose valuab-  le collaboration the book could not have appeared  in its present form. We gratefully acknowledge here  this accomplishment, as well as the excellent printing by J. Fink, StuttgartKemnat. All together, care was taken to leave the work un-  touched. Contents and sequence of pages have  been retained, some of the illustrations enlarged  and improved according to existing copies. The aim  of the new edition is to make Johannes Itten’s color  theory available again, improved and strictly adhering to his principles of presentation.

#### INTRODUCTION 

Learning from books and teachers is like traveling by carriage, so we are told in the Veda. The thought goes on, “But the carriage will serve only while one is on the highroad. He who reaches the end of the highroad will leave the carriage and walk afoot.” 

In this book I shall try to build a serviceable conveyance that will help all who are interested in the problems of color artistry. One may travel carriageless and by unblazed trails, but progress is then slow and the journey perilous. If a high and distant goal is to be attained, then it is advisable to take a carriage at first in order to advance swiftly and safely. 

Many of my students have helped me to find materials with which to build, and I am deeply indebted to them. The doctrine to be developed here is an aesthetic color theory originating in the experience and intuition of a painter. For the artist, effects are decisive, rather than agents as studied by physics and chemistry. Because color effects are in the eye of the beholder, the many color plates were indispensable. Yet the deepest and truest secrets of color effect are, I know, invisible even to the eye, and are beheld by the heart alone. The essential eludes conceptual formulation. 

In the realm of aesthetics, are there general rules and laws of color for the artist, or is the aesthetic appreciation of colors governed solely by subjective Opinion? Students often ask this question, and my answer is always the same: “If you, unknowing, are able to create masterpieces in color, then un-knowledge is your way. But if you are unable to create masterpieces in color out of your un- knowledge, then you ought to look for knowledge.” 

Doctrines and theories are best for weaker moments. In moments of strength, problems are solved intuitively, as if of themselves. 

Close study of the great master colorists has firmly convinced me that all of them possessed a science of color. For me, the theories of Goethe, Runge, Bezold, Chevreul and Hélzel have been invaluable. 

I hope to be able to resolve a great many color problems in this book. We are not merely to expound objective principles and rules, but also to explore and survey the subjective predicament, as it pertains to critical taste in the realm of color. 

We can be released from subjective bondage only through knowledge and awareness of objective principles. 

In music, the theory of composition has long been an important and accepted part of a professional education. However, a musician may know counterpoint and still be a dull composer, if he lacks insight and inspiration. Just so, a painter may know all the resources of composition in form and color, yet remain sterile if inspiration be denied him. 

It has been said that genius is 99 per cent perspiration and I per cent inspiration. There was a debate in the press years ago between Richard Strauss and Hans Pfitzner about the relative shares of inspiration and contrapuntal deduction in the process of composition. Strauss wrote that four to six bars were inspiration in his own works, and the rest elaboration. Pfitzner replied, “It may well be that Strauss is inspired only through four to six bars, but I have noticed that Mozart often composes many pages together under inspiration.” 

Leonardo, Direr, Grinewald, El Greco and the rest did not scorn to examine their artistic media intellectually. How could the Isenheim altarpiece have been produced, had not its creator pondered form and color? 

Knowledge of the laws of design need not imprison, it can liberate from indecision and vacillating perception. What we call laws of color, obviously, can be no more than fragmentary, given the complexity and irrationality of color effects. 

In the course of time, the human mind has penetrated many mysteries in their essence or in their mechanism - the rainbow, thunder and lightning, gravity and so on. But they are still mysteries for all that. 

Delacroix wrote, “The elements of color theory have been neither analyzed nor taught in our schools of art, because in France it is considered superfluous to study the laws of color, according to the saying ‘Draftsmen may be made, but colorists are born.’ Secrets of color theory? Why call those principles secrets which all artists must know and all should have been taught?” (Les Artistes de mon Temps). 

As the tortoise draws its limbs into its shell at need, so the artist reserves his scientific principles when working intuitively. But would it be better for the tortoise to have no legs? 

Color is life; for a world without colors appears to us as dead. Colors are primordial ideas, children of the aboriginal colorless light and its counterpart, colorless darkness. As flame begets light, so light engenders colors. Colors are the children of light, and light ts their mother. Light, that first phenomenon of the world, reveals to us the spirit and living soul of the world through colors. 

Nothing affects the human mind more dramati- cally than the apparition of a gigantic color corona in the heavens. Thunder and lightning frighten us; but the colors of the rainbow and the northern lights soothe and elevate the soul. The rainbow is accounted a symbol of peace. 

The word and its sound, form and its color, are vessels of a transcendental essence that we dimly surmise. As sound lends sparkling color to the spoken word, so color lends psychically resolved tone to form. 

The primeval essence of color is a phantas- magorical resonance, light become music. At the moment when thought, concept, formulation, touch upon color, its spell is broken, and we hold in our hands a corpse. 

In the tinted monuments of past ages, we can trace the emotional dispositions of vanished peoples. The ancient Egyptians and Greeks greatly delighted in varicolored design. 

The Chinese were accomplished painters from early times. An emperor of the Han dynasty is recorded in 80 B.C. to have kept storehouses — a museum — of paintings collected by him, said to have been of great and colorful beauty. In the T'ang period (618-907 A.D), there arose a strongly colored mural and panel painting. About the same time, new yellow, red, green and blue ceramic glazes were developed. In the Sung dynasty (960-1279 A.D.), the sense of color was extraordinarily cultivated. Pictorial colors became more varied and at once more naturalistic. Ceramics evolved many new glazes of matchless beauty, such as celadon and clair de lune. 

Strongly colored Roman and Byzantine poly- chrome mosaics from the first millennium of the Christian era have been preserved in Europe. Mosaic art placed high demands on coloristic powers, because each color area is composed of numerous point elements, each requiring consider- ation and choice. The mosaic artists of Ravenna in the fifth and sixth centuries were able to produce many different effects with complementary colors. 

The mausoleum of Galla Placidia is dominated by a remarkable colored atmosphere of gray light. This effect is produced by bathing the blue mosaic walls of the interior in an orange light, filtered through narrow windows of orange-tinted alabaster. Orange and blue are complementary colors, the mixing of which yields gray. As the visitor moves about the shrine, he receives different quantities of light which is alternately accented blue and orange, the walls reflecting these colors at ever-changing angles. This interplay gives an impression of suffusion with color. 

In the early medieval illuminations of the Irish monks in the eighth and ninth centuries, we find a palette of great variety and subtlety. Most astonishing in their radiant power are those pages where the many different colors are rendered in equal brilliance. The resulting vivid cold-warm effects are such as we do not find again until the Impressionists and Van Gogh. Some leaves of the Book of Kells, for logic of chromatic execution and organic rhythm of line, are as magnificent and pure as a Bach fugue. The sensitivity and artistic intelli- gence of these “abstract” miniaturists had their monumental counterpart in the stained glass of the Middle Ages. Early stained glass employed only a few different colors, and therefore seems crude, for glassmaking techniques afforded few colors as yet. Anyone who has spent a day studying the windows in the cathedral at Chartres in the changing light, and has seen the setting sun kindle the great rose window to a splendid culminating chord, will never forget the supernal beauty of that moment. 

The Romanesque and Early Gothic artists, in their mural and tablet paintings, used colors as symbolic expressions. Therefore they endeavored to produce unequivocal, unclouded tones. Simple and clear symbolic effect was sought, rather than multitudinous shadings and chromatic variations. Form received a similar treatment. 

Giotto and the Sienese school may have been the first painters to indivualize the human figure in form and color, thus initiating a development that was to lead to the imposing throng of artist personalities encountered in the Europe of the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. 

In the first half of the fifteenth century, the brothers Hubert and Jan van Eyck began to construct patterns of composition around the local colors of the person or thing represented. These local colors, through dull and bright, light and dark tones, produced realistic images very closely approaching nature. Color became a means of characterizing natural objects. The Ghent altarpiece was finished in 1432, and in 1434 Jan van Eyck executed the first Gothic portrait, the double portrait of Arnolfini and his lady. 

Francesca (1410-1492) painted individuals in sharp outline and clearly expressive areas, with balancing complementary colors. The hues are rare tones especially characteristic of the artist. 

Leonardo (1452-1519) rejected strong coloration. He painted in infinitesimal tonal gradations, organized in the case of his “Virgin of the Grotto” into two principal planes. “St. Jerome” and the “Adoration” are composed entirely in sepia tones of light and shade. 

Titian (1477 - 1576) in his early work set homogeneous color areas against each other in isolation. Later, he progressively resolved such areas into cool and warm, light and dark, dull and intense modulations, perhaps best exemplified by the “Bella”, in the Pitti galleries. In the works of his old age, he evolved objects out of one principal hue and many variant tints and shades. The “Ecce Homo” is an example.
 
Fl Greco (1545 - 1614) was a pupil of Titian. He brought his master’s polytonality back to large, expressive color areas. His strange, frequently shocking color renditions cease to represent local colors, but are abstract, matching the psychically expressive requirements of the theme. This is why El Greco is considered a progenitor of nonobjective painting. His color areas do not denote objective categories. They have been organized into sheer pictorial polyphony. 

Grinewald (1475 - 1528), a century earlier, had solved this same problem. Where El Greco’s shades are always sharply and characteristically defined by gray and black tones, Grinewald set color against color. Through what may be called an objective mastery of the universe of color, he discovered the appropriate colors for each pictorial motif. The Isenheim altarpiece in all its parts shows such multiplicity of color quality, effect and expression as to be properly called an intellectually universal color composition. The Annunciation, Angel Choir (Plate IX), Crucifixion, Resurrection (Plate XXVII), are pictures utterly different from each other, in form as well as color. 

In fact, Grinewald sacrificed decorative unity of the altarpiece as a whole to artistic truth of the individual theme. He set himself above the scholastic canon, in order to be truthful and objective. However, the psychologically expressive power of his colors, their symbolic verity, and their realistic signification — all these three potentialities of color are, in a deeper sense, fused into unity.
